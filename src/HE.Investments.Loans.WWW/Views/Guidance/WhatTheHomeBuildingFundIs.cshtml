        What the Home Building Fund is
    </gds-h2>

    <gds-p>
        Homes England is providing a £1.5bn Levelling Up Home Building Fund to support small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs),
        innovative developers and housebuilders to build more homes and create great communities.
    </gds-p>
    <gds-p>Loans will encourage traditional housebuilding, as well as innovative projects, including:</gds-p>
    <gds-ul>
        <gds-li>serviced plots for custom and self-builders</gds-li>
        <gds-li>off-site manufacturing</gds-li>
        <gds-li>developments focussing on sustainability and renewable energy generation</gds-li>
        <gds-li>new entrants to the market</gds-li>
        <gds-li>community-led housing projects</gds-li>
        <gds-li>groups of small firms working together to deliver larger sites</gds-li>
    </gds-ul>

    <gds-h3 size="ControlSize.M">
        How the fund works
    </gds-h3>

    <gds-p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">
        The Levelling Up Home Building Fund offers development finance from £250,000.
        We will also consider smaller loans for innovative housing solutions.
    </gds-p>
    <gds-p>Note that:</gds-p>
    <gds-ul>
        <gds-li>typical terms are up to 5 years</gds-li>
        <gds-li>interest is payable at transparent, commercial, pre-agreed rates</gds-li>
        <gds-li>sales income from the homes sold can be recycled to meet future costs and minimise the loan request</gds-li>
        <gds-li>we will consider subordinated lending</gds-li>
        <gds-li>we will discuss eligible costs with each applicant</gds-li>
    </gds-ul>

    <gds-p>
        If you have a viable scheme that offers innovative housing solutions, and needs development funding outside of the parameters above,
        contact us to discuss further.
    </gds-p>

    <gds-p>All loans are typically secured via fixed charges against the development site, or as floating charges against the development company.</gds-p>
