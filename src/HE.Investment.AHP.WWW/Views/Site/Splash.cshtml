            The Continuous Market Engagement (CME) route provides access to grant funding
            throughout the duration of the programme, while funding remains available. You can
            apply for funding for individual schemes, but all schemes funded through CME must:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>start on site by 30 September 2025</li>
                <li>be completed by 31 March 2026</li>
            </ul>
        </gds-p>
        <gds-p>
            You do not need to be an investment partner to apply for funding through CME.
            However, you must have gained investment partner status before your application
            can be approved and a funding allocation agreed.
        </gds-p>
        <gds-p>
            As part of your application, you will need to provide details about your scheme. For

                <li>geography</li>
