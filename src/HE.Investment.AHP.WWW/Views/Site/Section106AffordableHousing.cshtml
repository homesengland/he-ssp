            Developer contributions are planning tools that can be used to secure
            financial and non-financial contributions. This can include affordable
            housing or other works to provide infrastructure to support development
            or mitigate the impact of development.

            those phases are not covered by this application. This includes different
            phases if they are covered by the same planning permission.
