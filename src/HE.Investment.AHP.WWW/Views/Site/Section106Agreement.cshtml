            You'll need to provide details of any section 106 agreements (or planning conditions
            performing the same purpose) that are in place or under discussion for your site.
        </gds-p>
        <gds-p>
            Section 106 (s106) agreements are legally-binding agreements or planning obligations with a
            landowner agreed as part of the granting of planning permission.
        </gds-p>
        <gds-p>
            If there is an s106 agreement in place or in discussion, answer yes.
            You should still answer yes even if your s106 does not include a provision to secure the delivery
            of affordable housing through developer contributions.
        </gds-p>
        <gds-p>
            If you expect there to be a s106 with developer contributions securing the affordable housing.
            discuss funding eligibility with your Growth Manager.
