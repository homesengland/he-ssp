        In this section, you’ll need to provide information about the homes on this application. This includes:
    </gds-p>
    <gds-ul>
        <gds-li>the number of homes</gds-li>
        <gds-li>building information</gds-li>
        <gds-li>the floor area </gds-li>
        <gds-li>Nationally Described Space Standards</gds-li>
        <gds-li>the design and client group information for specialist housing</gds-li>
        <gds-li>Rent or Shared Ownership details, depending on the tenure of your application</gds-li>
        <gds-li>Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)</gds-li>
    </gds-ul>

    <gds-p class="govuk-!-margin-top-8">
        Where you have homes on your application that are identical, you are able to record those as one home type.
    </gds-p>
    <gds-p>
        If there are any differences in the homes, you’ll need to create a new home type.
    </gds-p>
    <gds-p>
        Once you have created one home type, you will be able to duplicate this and amend any necessary details to create another.
