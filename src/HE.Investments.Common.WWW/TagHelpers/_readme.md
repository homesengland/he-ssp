- TagHelpers in He.AspNetCore.Mvc.Gds.Components package does not contains implementation for all [GDS (gov.uk Design System) components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components) (depends on package version).
- TagHelpers with "He" prefix were created here as a wrappers for GDS components that are not available in He.AspNetCore.Mvc.Gds.Components package or has different implementation.
- "He" prefix was used to distinguish GDS basic components created here from components in He.AspNetCore.Mvc.Gds.Components package ("gds" prefix).
- Components without prefix are more related with HE domain than GDS.
